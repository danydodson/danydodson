## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adithya, a 22-year-old Full-Stack Designer from Bengaluru, India.  

I'm a React nanodegree graduate, and an IDF certified UX Designer. Free time is hard to come by, but when it does, I freelance and craft web apps for a living.  

#### Background 

I studied computer science and engineering at RNS Institute of Technology, Bangalore. During my time at RNSIT, I volunteered as a graphic designer with a small team that helped me jumpstart and hone my skills as a digital designer.  

Aside from design, I also build web apps using technologies like React, Node and many more tools. I'm currently working at [Betsol](https://betsol.com) as a Web Architect on a product called Leto. I'm involved in the design (both UI/UX and architecture) and development of the product using React, Redux, Node and Postgres.
